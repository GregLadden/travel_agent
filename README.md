# Travel Agent - Transformer Demo

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of a transformer model to generate travel suggestions. It showcases how the LLaMA-3 model from Hugging Face can generate meaningful outputs based on user input, such as recommending vacation destinations.

The purpose of this project is to explore the basic mechanics of transformers and illustrate their potential in generating personalized responses. While some outputs are relevant, others highlight the need for fine-tuning to improve accuracy.
